      title: "Migration is an integral part of the human story",
      content: {
        part1:
          "People want to know that wherever life takes them they will be received with dignity and respect. Even though the people I met were fleeing situations where their lives were at risk, they were thinking about more than just survival.",
        part2:
          "The opportunity to have choice and exert personal freedom is a key driver pushing many refugees to urban areas and away from refugee camps, which are isolating and viewed as sites of stagnation. Refugees want to put down roots, utilize their skills, and contribute to their communities.",
        part3:
          "Despite this, the international community still does not recognize migration from conflict as a human right, instead treating refugees as in need of temporary protection. Protection is a one-way street, but refugees don’t want to just be passive receivers. When mobility is treated as a human right, there is less marginalization of people on the move and more opportunities for newcomers to contribute to the sustainable development of receiving countries.",

        "Rather than being disenfranchised by borders and regulations, asylum seekers exercise agency as they encounter, contend with, resist, and move across borders – both physical and legal.",
      content: {
        part1:
          "Asylum seekers demonstrate remarkable adaptability and resilience, leveraging technology and word-of-mouth networks to navigate the intricacies of migration routes, identify safe havens, and access vital resources.",
        part2:
          "Along the journey, they often provide mutual aid, aiding fellow seekers in avoiding detection by authorities until they can formally seek asylum in their destination country.",
        part3:
          "Their deep understanding of the intricate web of immigration policies and regulations shapes their decisions, yet this knowledge remains predominantly disseminated through informal channels.",
        part4:
          "This reliance on word-of-mouth communication presents inherent limitations, leading to missed opportunities to democratize access to critical information throughout the journey.",

      title:
        "Spaces at the margins – of society, of the law, of protected status, of national borders – present the most formative spaces for reimagining what is possible for asylum seekers.",
      content: {
        part1:
          "Repeatedly throughout my interactions, I encountered instances where asylum seekers actively enriched and strengthened the fabric of local receiving communities.",
        part2:
          "Notably, informal education systems emerged as pivotal arenas wherein recent arrivals engaged in a reciprocal exchange of their diverse skills and talents with local residents. These educational platforms not only facilitated the transmission of knowledge but also fostered meaningful connections and cultural exchange between individuals from varied backgrounds.",
        part3:
          "This two-way interaction not only benefits the asylum seekers by providing avenues for self-expression and integration but also enriches the local community by tapping into a wealth of diverse perspectives and expertise.",
        part4:
          "Such collaborative initiatives underscore the transformative potential of grassroots engagement in fostering solidarity and building inclusive communities amidst the challenges of forced displacement.",

        "Asylum seekers are looking for receiving countries that can recognize their full humanity, including by utilizing their skills, pursuing their dreams, and achieving their aspirations.",
      content: {
        part1:
          "Asylum seekers aren't simply looking to access services or be passive recipients of resources; rather, they aspire to find mentors and guides who can empower them to realize their full potential.",
        part2:
          "Amidst their journey, structural barriers, particularly in education and employment, frequently hinder the recognition and utilization of their pre-existing skills. These obstacles not only impede individual progress but also limit the broader societal benefits that arise from harnessing the talents and experiences of asylum seekers.",
        part3:
          "By addressing these barriers and creating pathways for skill recognition and development, communities can unlock the untapped potential within their refugee populations.",
        part4:
          "This shift from a passive recipient model to one centered on empowerment and collaboration not only benefits asylum seekers but also fosters a more inclusive and dynamic society where everyone can contribute and thrive.",
